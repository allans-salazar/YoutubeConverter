# YoutubeConverter
My own application for youtube videos without the use of online converters. Thanks for Tech With Tim for showing off the "pytube" python package and inspiring to make this project. My first ever project done. Hoping to finish and use when I need. Started: 2/27/2024

I like to download alot of videos to save and hate the struggle of using the online mp4 converters. So seeing this I just had to make a application with a GUI!
