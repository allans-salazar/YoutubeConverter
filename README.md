# YoutubeConverter
My own application for youtube videos without the use of online converters. Thanks for Tech With Tim for showing off the "pytube" python package and inspiring to make this project.



Using and installing "pyinstaller" I was able to create the app on my laptop and use it with the command line: 

`pyinstaller --onedir --noconsole --icon YoutubeDownloadIcon.icns --name YoutubeConverter main.py`


I grabbed the icon from this website: https://www.iconarchive.com/show/papirus-apps-icons-by-papirus-team/youtube-dl-icon.html


This is a preview of the app on my laptop:

*UNFORTUNATELY... Python Library 'pytube' no longer is being support making the application unable to work as well.*
